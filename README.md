If user does not input number the code will stop them from getting them a proper result
* “three”
* “please put in a number”

The program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user’s inputted number
* “6”
* “0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6”

Instead of displaying a 1 when returning user number
Display “Beep!”
* “3”
* “0, Beep!, 2, 3”

Instead of displaying a 2 when returning user number
Display “Boop!”
* “3”
* “0, Beep!,Boop!, 3”

Instead of displaying a 2 when returning user number
Display "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
* “3”
* “0, Beep!,Boop!,I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.”

Most important spec applies above all else
* “13”
* “...,I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.”
