#### By _**Duncan Robbins**_

## Description

_user inputs number and it returns all the numbers leading up to it along with a series of beep boop or im sorry if it is a 1 2 3 respectively_
## Specs
If user does not input number the code will stop them from getting them a proper result
* input: “three”
* “please put in a number”

The program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user’s inputted number
* input: “6”
* output: “0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6”

Instead of displaying a 1 when returning user number
Display “Beep!”
* input: “3”
* output: “0, Beep!, 2, 3”

Instead of displaying a 2 when returning user number
Display “Boop!”
* input: “3”
* output: “0, Beep!,Boop!, 3”

Instead of displaying a 2 when returning user number
Display "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
* input: “3”
* output: “0, Beep!,Boop!,I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.”

Most important spec applies above all else
* input: “13”
* output: “0, beep, boop, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, beep, boop, I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.”
